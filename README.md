# salesforce-alm

**This code is read-only and not meant to be executed, edited, or contributed to.** 

This repository represents a snapshot of the [salesforce-alm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/salesforce-alm) (commonly referred to as the toolbelt) plug-in source code for the [Salesforce CLI](https://developer.salesforce.com/tools/sfdxcli). The toolbelt is the largest plug-in for the CLI and it contains most of the force commands including the [source format](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/en/content/learn/modules/sfdx_dev_model/sfdx_dev_model_sdd) and conversion for commands.
 
Our goal is to completely open-source all Salesforce CLI source: the toolbelt plus all Salesforce CLI repositories and plug-ins. This toolbelt snapshot is the first step towards full open-source Salesforce CLI code. 
 
Why aren’t we open-sourcing everything right now? We’ve had an overwhelming number of requests to look at the toolbelt code. This snapshot is a stopgap. The CLI team is working on open source plans. We’ve determined it will take a significant amount of engineering hours to migrate our current development and build process to an open source repository. Therefore, we will move code in chunks as we break up the toolbelt into plug-ins and open source as we go.
 
Updates: We plan to release an update of this code every Salesforce Release (three times per year). This way the community will be able to investigate any changes to the toolbelt as they come out.

Please continue to provide feedback at the [Salesforce CLI issues only repo](https://github.com/forcedotcom/cli). We will not be accepting PRs to this repository.
